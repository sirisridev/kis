# Tesla Model Y Long Range - ON ROAD 50.4K, after tax savings 42.9K

## Range - 178 miles only not 330 miles.
- Tesla published range for Model Y long range is 330 miles. Tesla recommends to charge upto 80% only, also advises to charge just below 20%.
So you are left with only 60%, that is 300 * 60% = 198 miles.
- So idle roads, idle weather, idle driver, idle etc gets 198 miles. Those exist only in Tesla labs and we don't have any of those, so if we are lucky we get 90% of 198 miles, that is 178 miles.
- So its strongly recommended to plan for super charing time also when are travelling longer than 178 miles.
